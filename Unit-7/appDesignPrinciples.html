                research: "B.F. Skinner discovered that subjects in a 'Skinner Box' would press a lever most frantically when the reward (food) was given at random intervals rather than every time. This is the foundation of slot machines and social media feeds.",
                examples: ["<strong>TikTok/Reels:</strong> Swiping down is exactly like pulling a slot machine lever. Will the next video be funny (reward) or boring?", "<strong>Email:</strong> We check our inbox constantly because once in a while, there is an 'important' message among the spam."],
                challenge: "<strong>Class Challenge: The Phantom Vibration.</strong> Ask the students: How many of you have 'felt' your phone vibrate in your pocket, only to find no notification? This is your brain's anticipation of a variable reward. Why does the 'uncertainty' make us check more often than a guaranteed 'like'?",
                impact: "Feeds are designed to be 'bottomless' to ensure the user never reaches a natural stopping point while waiting for that next hit of dopamine.",

                challenge: "<strong>Spot the 'Dark Pattern':</strong> Present this scenario: You see a countdown timer for a sale. If you refresh the page and the timer starts over, is that ethical design or a lie? Discuss: Does fake urgency destroy brand trust in the long run?",
                impact: "Using high-contrast colors (Red/Orange) for countdowns and 'Low Stock' badges to trigger the 'Fight or Flight' response in the brain.",

Which do you choose? Now apply this to apps: Why do we download the app with 1M downloads over a new one with 10 downloads, even if the new one is better?",
                impact: "Showcasing 'Best Seller' badges, user testimonials, and 'Joined by 5,000 others' text at critical decision points.",

                examples: ["<strong>Amazon:</strong> '1-Click Buy' is the ultimate removal of friction.", "<strong>iOS:</strong> FaceID to pay means you don't even have to remember a password to spend money."],
                challenge: "<strong>The 'Friction' Exercise:</strong> Ask students: Why is it one click to 'Subscribe' to a service, but five pages of questions to 'Unsubscribe'? This is 'Strategic Friction.' Is it ethical to make it harder to leave than to join?",
                impact: "Using 'Smart Defaults' (pre-filling your address) and Biometrics to make spending money feel 'weightless.'",

                research: "Kahneman & Tversky's Prospect Theory. We will take bigger risks to *avoid a loss* than we will to *achieve a gain*.",
                examples: ["<strong>Snapchat:</strong> 'Streaks.' Users aren't messaging for the content; they are messaging to avoid 'losing' the number.", "<strong>Dropbox:</strong> 'Your storage is full. Files may be deleted soon.'"],
                challenge: "<strong>Think Like a User:</strong> Which notification is more effective? A) 'Earn $10 today if you complete this task!' or B) 'Your $10 reward will expire in 2 hours. Claim it now!' Ask students why 'B' creates more anxiety and action.",
                impact: "Using 'Countdown to Expiration' and 'Don't Lose Your Progress' messaging in copy.",
                ethics: "Overusing loss aversion can create a 'Negative Reinforcement' loop where users only use the app out of fear/anxiety."

                research: "The 'Anchor' effect. If I show you a $2,000 watch first, a $500 watch looks like a 'deal.' If I show you a $50 watch first, the $500 one looks 'expensive.'",
                examples: ["<strong>Netflix:</strong> Showing the 'Premium' plan next to the 'Basic' plan to make the middle one look like the best value.", "<strong>Sales:</strong> Crossing out $99.00 and writing $49.00."],
                challenge: "<strong>The Coffee Shop Experiment:</strong> A Small is $3, a Large is $7. Most buy the Small. If you add a 'Medium' for $6.50, people buy the Large because it's 'only 50 cents more' than the Medium. This is a 'Decoy.' How can we use decoys in App Subscriptions?",
                impact: "Positioning the most profitable option as the 'Recommended' choice in the center of the screen.",

                impact: "Providing 'Value-First' onboarding. Show the user what the app can do for them *before* asking for their data or money.",
                ethics: "Is it a gift, or is it bait? Reciprocity becomes unethical when the 'gift' is used to manipulate people into sharing sensitive data."

                research: "In countries where organ donation is the 'Default' (Opt-Out), rates are near 99%. In 'Opt-In' countries, they are often below 15%. Defaults are the most powerful tool in design.",

                challenge: "<strong>The 'Invisible Choice' Discussion:</strong> If a user doesn't change a setting, did they 'choose' it? Discuss: Should the most 'User-Friendly' (e.g., Privacy-focused) setting always be the default, even if it hurts the company's profit?",

                challenge: "<strong>The 'Checklist' Hook:</strong> Why is an 'Empty' checklist boring, but a checklist with 1 item already checked off (e.g., 'Account Created') highly motivating? Ask students: Does seeing your 'Streak' or 'Level' actually make the app better, or just more addictive?",
                impact: "Using progress bars, leveling systems, and badges to gamify mundane tasks.",
